Please note that only members can post, but anyone can join.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing the cookiecutter CLI\r\n\r\nThe following installs the `cookiecutter` command line tool into your `$HOME`,\r\nin a dedicated directory you can easily get rid of.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# possibly activate a HTTP proxy or PyPI mirror here, if you're firewalled\r\n\r\n# install \"cookiecutter\" to its own virtualenv\r\nmkdir -p ~/bin ~/.local/venvs\r\ntest -d ~/.local/venvs/cookiecutter \\\r\n    || virtualenv ~/.local/venvs/cookiecutter\r\n~/.local/venvs/cookiecutter/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools wheel\r\n~/.local/venvs/cookiecutter/bin/pip install -U cookiecutter\r\nln -s ~/.local/venvs/cookiecutter/bin/cookiecutter ~/bin\r\ncookiecutter --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo change this to the *patched version* which supports license post-processing\r\nand easy upgrading of existing projects, also run this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n~/.local/venvs/cookiecutter/bin/pip install -U \\\r\n    https://github.com/jhermann/cookiecutter/archive/master.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using the templates\r\n\r\nThe Springerle [cookie-jar](https://github.com/Springerle/cookie-jar) repository collects pointers\r\nto ‘releases’ of the templates, i.e. references to tags in the various subprojects.\r\nThese take the form of git submodules, so that you can check out all the templates in one fell swoop,\r\nand use them off-line or package them in some form.\r\n\r\n:bulb: | To get *your* defaults for common template values `cookiecutter` will ask you for when you use a template, it makes sense to have a [~/.cookiecutterrc](https://github.com/jhermann/ruby-slippers/blob/master/home/.cookiecutterrc) in your home directory. Follow the link to see an example.\r\n---- | :----\r\n\r\n## Project Archetype Tools\r\n\r\n * [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)\r\n\r\n * [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) – The web's scaffolding tool for modern webapps.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Addendum\r\n\r\n![CC0 license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0-red.svg)  *for this page (README).*\r\n\r\n[![1&1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1and1/1and1.github.io/master/images/1and1-logo-42.png)](https://github.com/1and1)  Project sponsored by [1&1](https://github.com/1and1).\r\n",
