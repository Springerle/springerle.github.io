{"name":"Springerle","tagline":"A collection of cookiecutter molds.","body":"# ![❏](https://raw.github.com/Springerle/springerle.github.io/master/static/img/logo-64.png) Springerle\r\n\r\nThis is the website for “Springerle” ([/ʃpʀɪŋɛʀlə/](https://translate.google.com/#de/de/Springerle)),\r\na collection of cookiecutter molds mostly for Python and Java.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Goals\r\n\r\nThe main goal of *Springerle* is to provide basic templates and add-on facets to incrementally set up projects in a flexible and composable manner.\r\n\r\nSee “[Using the templates](#using-the-templates)” for details on which templates are available,\r\nand the following section for pre-requisites.\r\nTo talk about the templates contained in the project, and to get support, please use the\r\n[springerle-users](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/springerle-users)\r\nGoogle group / mailing list. Please note that only members can post, but anyone can join.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing the cookiecutter CLI\r\n\r\nIf you are on a 64bit Linux machine, use the *PEX release* as follows:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl -Lo ~/bin/cookiecutter \\\r\n    \"https://github.com/jhermann/cookiecutter/releases/download/v1.0.1/cookiecutter-1.0.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.pex\"\r\nchmod a+x ~/bin/cookiecutter\r\ncookiecutter --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn other platforms, the following is an easy way to install the `cookiecutter` command line tool into your `$HOME`,\r\nwith the help of [pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi).\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# add \"pipsi\" bin dir to PATH, permanently\r\ngrep '/.local/bin:' ~/.bash_aliases >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo >>~/.bash_aliases \\\r\n    'grep \":$HOME/.local/bin:\" <<<\":$PATH:\" >/dev/null || export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"'\r\nsource ~/.bash_aliases\r\n\r\n# possibly activate a HTTP proxy or PyPI mirror here, if you're firewalled\r\n\r\n# install \"pipsi\" and \"cookiecutter\"\r\nwhich pipsi || curl \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/master/get-pipsi.py\" | python\r\nwhich cookiecutter || pipsi install cookiecutter\r\ncookiecutter --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo upgrade this to the enhanced version which supports license post-processing\r\nand easy upgrading of existing projects, also run this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n~/.local/venvs/cookiecutter/bin/pip install -U \\\r\n    https://github.com/jhermann/cookiecutter/archive/master.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\n:bulb: | If you later want to update to a new official release version, just issue a `pipsi upgrade cookiecutter` command and you're done.\r\n---- | :----\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using the templates\r\n\r\nThe Springerle [cookie-jar](https://github.com/Springerle/cookie-jar) repository collects pointers\r\nto ‘releases’ of the templates, i.e. references to tags in the various subprojects.\r\nThese take the form of git submodules, so that you can check out all the templates in one fell swoop,\r\nand use them off-line or package them in some form.\r\n\r\n:bulb: | To get *your* defaults for common template values `cookiecutter` will ask you for when you use a template, it makes sense to have a [~/.cookiecutterrc](https://github.com/jhermann/ruby-slippers/blob/master/home/.cookiecutterrc) in your home directory. Follow the link to see an example.\r\n---- | :----\r\n\r\n## Project Archetype Tools\r\n\r\n * [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)\r\n\r\n * [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) – The web's scaffolding tool for modern webapps.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Addendum\r\n\r\n![CC0 license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0-red.svg)  *for this page (README).*\r\n\r\n[![1&1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1and1/1and1.github.io/master/images/1and1-logo-42.png)](https://github.com/1and1)  Project sponsored by [1&1](https://github.com/1and1).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
